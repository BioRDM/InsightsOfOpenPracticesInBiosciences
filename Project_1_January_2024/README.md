## General Information

### 1. Abstract: 

The evolution of scientific research now emphasizes Open Data's role in fostering transparency and collaboration. This study evaluates the University of Edinburgh's progress in adopting open data practices, particularly since its 2021 open research policy. Our analysis analyses biosciences research data sharing from 2014 to 2022, reviewing 193 papers for their adherence to Openness and FAIRness criteria: Completeness, Reusability, Accessibility, and Licensing. Findings reveal an uptick in data completeness and reusability, with genome data being shared more frequently than image data. Data availability statements (DAS) and preprint sharing show a strong correlation with higher Openness and FAIRness scores. Furthermore, the FAIR principal implementation in 2016 had a positive impact on data reusability and a notable increase in DAS. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic shows a substantial increase in preprint sharing and a continued trend towards open data sharing, while also resulting in significant improvements in 'Complete,' 'Reuse,' and 'Access' scores. This paper spotlights The University of Edinburgh's journey towards open data, addressing the changes and advocating for best practices to nurture this progression.

## Project_1_January_2024 Folder Description

### 1. Biosciences_Publications_Dataset_2024

This dataset, derived from a comprehensive analysis of selected publications in the field of biosciences, is presented in CSV format. It is designed for use with statistical software, such as RStudio, to facilitate detailed analysis.
CSV File Structure: The dataset contains rows corresponding to selected publications, each characterized by a set of variables critical to our study. The columns in the CSV file represent these variables.

#### Excel File Structure (Biosciences_Publications_Dataset_2024.xlsx)
* Sheet 1 (Dataset): Contains rows of selected publications and columns representing the variables used in our analysis.The raws that are highlighted in yellow, are the papers that have been randomly selected for reassessing   
* Sheet 2 (Variable Descriptions): Provides a detailed explanation of each variable and the values they represent.

#### CSV File (Biosciences_Publications_Dataset_2024.csv)
The CSV file is derived from Sheet 1 of the Excel file and was imported into RStudio for analysis.

#### Variable Descriptions
The dataset comprises the following variables:

| Variable | Description - (Format) | 
|------------|------------|
| Title         |The title of the article	-(Text)

### RMarkdown Code 

##### Biosciences_Project_RMarkdown_Code_Version1.Rmd
The RMarkdown code file encompasses all the code used to analyse the dataset and generate the results presented in the paper and supplementary materials. Each section of the code is titled for ease of navigation, and comments within the code provide explanations and context. Before each statistical test, the assumptions are assessed and documented within the corresponding code chunk.
Each code chunk in the RMarkdown file is clearly referenced to indicate where its results are presented in the paper, whether in the main text, figures, or tables. This cross-referencing ensures that readers can easily locate the source of each result and understand how it contributes to the findings of the research.

##### Biosciences_Project_RMarkdown_Code_Version1.pdf
The provided PDF is a knitted version of the RMarkdown code, presenting a static and complete view of the code, figures, and tables as outputs. This format enhances accessibility, allowing those not versed with RStudio or RMarkdown to easily view and share the research findings. It also acts as an archival record, capturing the code in a fixed form to preserve the analysis for future reproducibility. Additionally, the PDF format offers the convenience of a quick review or a printout of the research methods and outcomes, streamlining the understanding of the study's methodology and findings in one document.


**Usage Instructions:** 

To use the RMarkdown code
- Open the .Rmd file in RStudio.
- Import the csv file "Biosciences_Publications_Dataset_2024.csv"
- Ensure that the required libraries are installed:
  - dplyr  
  - lubridate
