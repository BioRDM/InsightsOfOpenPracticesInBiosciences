# Repository README File: Insights of Open Practices in Biosciences
-------------------------------------------------------------------

## General Information
This reposotory contains the outcomes of a project executed at the Biosciences Institutes of the University of Edinburgh. This research project assesses the openness and FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) of data linked to publications from these institutes. Here, you will find datasets, analytical codes, and figures that detail our projectâ€™s methodology, results, and broader implications, aiming to enhance data-sharing practices and promote the adherence to FAIR principles within and beyond our community.
Each folder within this repository contains a distinct dataset, enabling structured and organised access to diverse sets of data relevant to the same project's scope.

## Protocol: 
The protocol for this project can be found on Protocol.io, where detailed step-by-step guidelines are provided to ensure that the research methods are transparent and reproducible.

## Folder Description

### 1. Project_1  
This folder conatins the outcomes of the first project, centered on publications in infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases. DataSet_v1 encompasses all relevant files from a sample of 193 publications dated between 2014 to 2022. These documents form the cornerstone of the findings presented in this preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.18.580901

### 2. Project_2_Latest
This folder contains the outcomes of the second project, encompassing publications in biotechnology, regenerative medicine, infectious diseases, and non-communicable diseases. DataSet_v2 includes all publications from the previous project (DataSet_V1) plus new additions, totaling 555 publications from 2014 to 2023. This project builds upon the first by integrating prior data with new data, representing an advanced phase of our ongoing research. this folder, DataSet_v2, contains all the data outputs and analytical results of this comprehensive second project.
